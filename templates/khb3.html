    <p>In 1908, Khudiram joined Anushilan Samiti and under Aurobindo Ghose and his brother Barindra Ghose, he got fully involved in anti-British activities. The revolutionary had a fearless spirit and is known for the attempt to assassinate the district magistrate of Muzaffarpur, Douglas Kingsford. Its leaders then decided to appoint Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Kumar Chaki to conduct the mission of assassinating Douglas H Kingsford through a bomb attack, and Khudiram was only 18 years old at this time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, it was discovered later that the carriage was carrying the wife and daughter of a barrister called Pringle Kennedy, and Kingsford had escaped yet another attempt on his life. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Britishers set out to nab Bose and Chaki after the attempt. However, Chaki shot himself before they could get to him. Khudiram Bose was caught and put to trial. He was then hanged, at the young age of 18, for the attempt of assassination, making him one of the youngest revolutionaries in India to be hanged by the British and Prafulla Kumar Chaki committed suicide. </p>
