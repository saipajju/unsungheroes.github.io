    <p>Inspired by the speeches of Sri Aurobindo, Khudiram Bose took part in the secret planning sessions that were held by Sri Aurobindo and Sister Nivedita. Shortly after, in the year 1904, Khudiram Bose shifted from Tamluk to the main town of Medinipur, not only to enroll at the Medinipur Collegiate School but also to take part in the martyr activities that were then a common occurrence in principal towns across India. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In 1905, during the Partition of Bengal, he became an active volunteer in the freedom movement. Besides all his fearless acts, Khudiram Bose was well known for all the pamphlets he distributed to the common people to seek their attention on going against the British in the great struggle for freedom.</p>
    <br>
    <p>  Just around then, the Britishers caught him distributing pamphlets with anti-British propaganda. After which, he involved himself even further by planting bombs near police stations to target officials. </p>
