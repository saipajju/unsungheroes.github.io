    <p>Khudiram Bose was from a small village called Mohobani which was in West Bengal's Midnapore. Bose was born on December 3, 1889. Many say that Khudiram’s legacy has been largely limited to Bengal.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Growing up, he faced several devastations. He lost his mother at the tender age of 6, and his father just a year later. After which, Bose encountered revolutionaries like Barindra Kumar Ghosh of Calcutta. Khudiram Bose showed a revolutionary spirit even when he was a mere child. As a child Khudiram Bose loved adventure and was widely known for his courage in the face of danger. It was in the years 1902 - 1903 that Khudiram Bose was inspired to plunge into an active freedom struggle. During this time Sri Aurobindo and Sister Nivedita were in Medinipur to deliver a lecture inspiring people to join the freedom struggle against the British during the Swadeshi Movement, which highly inspired Khudiram. </p>
