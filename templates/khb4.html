    <p>Khudiram Bose was a brave freedom fighter who fought for the independence of our country and laid down his life for it. The revolutionary had a fearless spirit and is known for the attempt to assassinate the district magistrate of Muzaffarpur, Douglas Kingsford.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Khudiram Bose was one of the youngest freedom fighters that gave up their life for the country. Newspaper reports from then have said that he went to the gallows with a smile on his face. Later, Muzaffarpur jail, where he was put to death, was named after him.</p>
